       The fiscal year of 2018 was an important year for Furla, the Italian luxury leather brand.
       Furla took over full control of the distribution networks in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore.
       Furla also invested heavily in supply chain optimization. The Global CEO of Furla Group,
       Camerlengo expressed that this was all about laying the groundwork for future development.
       He said, “We want the company to be profitable today, as well as in 90 years.”<br><br><br>
       With in-depth analysis on Furla Group’ latest financial report of 2018,
       Luxe.Co had an exclusive interview with Mr. Alberto Camerlengo,
       who shared his insights on Furla’s brand images, and the China market strategy.

        Luxe.Co: Over the past four fiscal years, Furla Group has doubled its turnover.
        However in the recent fiscal year, the company only had a single-digit growth.
        How do you see the slow-down of the growth?<br><br><br>
        Camerlengo: We hit 513 million euros in 2018, with a 5.2% increase at constant exchange rate over 2017,
        and a doubled turnover over the past four fiscal years. These are highly satisfying financial results for us,
        which we have achieved at a challenging time for the international market.
        Our single and fundamental goal has always been to guarantee continuity and excellence in all of Furla’s creations.
        I believe that the reasons for our continuous growth are a winning mix of Furla’s key strengths: our people,
        our wide and well-developed distribution network, constant research on products and great
        2018 has also been a year in which we have invested significant financial resources in managing
        the unrestrained growth that the company has experienced over the past several years,
        from acquiring total control of our retail distribution network in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore,
        to strengthening our supply chain. These steps are important for our goal of long-term growth.
        We want the company to be profitable today, as well as in 90 years. <br><br><br>Luxe.Co: The Asia Pacific region
        (including China) now accounts for 26% of the group’s total turnover.
